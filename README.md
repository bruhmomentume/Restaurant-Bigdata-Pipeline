## 🎯 Project Overview



A production-grade **Big Data pipeline** that ingests, cleans, transforms, and serves **11 million+ records** from a multi-branch Egyptian restaurant chain. Built using the **Medallion Architecture** on **Databricks**, orchestrated with **Apache Airflow**, and visualized in **Power BI**.



This project demonstrates real-world data engineering skills including large-scale data processing, pipeline orchestration, data quality management, star schema modeling, and business intelligence delivery.

📊 Data Quality Results



Metric Value

Raw Records Ingested 11,110,000

Duplicate Order IDs Removed 2,000,000

Invalid Price Records Removed 51,442

Null Values Found 0

Clean Unique Orders 2,497,678



Key insight: The raw dataset contained duplicate records that inflated order counts by 4x. Proper deduplication reduced 11.1M records to 2.49M clean, trustworthy orders — a critical data engineering decision that ensures accurate reporting.

🔄 Airflow DAG



The DAG restaurant_medallion_pipeline runs on a daily schedule and orchestrates the full pipeline:



```

start

  └─► ingest_bronze      (Unify 7 CSV + 2 JSON → Bronze Delta table)

        └─► clean_silver  (Clean, dedupe, engineer features → Silver)

              └─► build_gold  (Star schema → Gold layer)

                    └─► data_quality_check  (Validate row counts, nulls, margins)

                          └─► notify_success  (Log pipeline summary)

                                └─► end

```



Quality checks in the DAG:



· Row count validation (expected: ~2.49M)

· Null value assertion across all columns

· Duplicate check on order IDs

· Profit margin sanity check (expected: 60–75%)

💡 Profit Model



Since cost data was not available in the raw dataset, profit was modeled using industry-standard assumptions:



Cost Driver Assumption Rationale

Food Cost 30% of order revenue Industry standard F&B cost ratio

Delivery Cost 15 EGP flat per delivery order Fixed logistics cost per order

Card Processing Fee 1.5% of order value Standard merchant processing rate



Formula:



```

Profit = Revenue − Food Cost − Delivery Cost − Payment Cost

Profit Margin = (Profit / Revenue) × 100

```

🚀 How to Run



Prerequisites



· Databricks Community Edition account

· Apache Airflow installed (Ubuntu/Linux recommended)

· Power BI Desktop



Steps



1. Upload data to Databricks



```

Upload CSV and JSON files to Databricks FileStore

Run: SHOW TABLES to verify tables are created

```



2. Run notebooks in order



```

01_bronze_ingestion.py  →  Creates bronze_orders

02_silver_cleaning.py   →  Creates silver_orders

03_gold_star_schema.py  →  Creates gold_fact_orders + 6 dimensions

```



3. Deploy Airflow DAG



```bash

cp dags/restaurant_pipeline_dag.py $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags/

airflow dags trigger restaurant_medallion_pipeline

```



4. Connect Power BI



```

Export Gold tables as CSV from Databricks

Load into Power BI Desktop

Relationships already configured in star schema

```

📌 Key Learnings



· Medallion Architecture is essential for large-scale data quality management

· Deduplication at scale requires careful key identification — order_id was the correct grain

· Profit modeling with assumed costs is a valid analytical technique when cost data is unavailable — the key is transparency about assumptions

· Pipeline orchestration with Airflow transforms a notebook exercise into a production system

· Star schema design decisions directly impact Power BI performance and DAX complexity
